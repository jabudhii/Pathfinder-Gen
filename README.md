# Pathfinder-Gen
ABANDONWARE - toy app meant to help with Pathfinder game running but never got enough attention

This program is relatively useless save for two main elements:
Anomaly Generation: when you want something completly random to occur in your world.
Loot Generation: A limited variation of loot generation, based upon player level.

Anomaly Generation is straight forward, while Loot Generation requires going through Enemy Generation and selecting the loot option.
